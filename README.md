# Gmail Notifr #

A RubyCocoa Gmail Notifier for Mac OS X

# Why Another Gmail Notifier? #

There's an official [Google Notifier](http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html) for Mac out there. For two reasons I don't like Google Notifier very much:

* You cannot configure it to check mail every N minutes. Whenever a new message is received, it will notify you. That disturbs.

* It installs and runs several daemon processes (Google Updater for example) without asking you. What's even worse, these processes remain after uninstalling Google Notifier.
	
There's an alternative great free Gmail notifier [GmailStatus](http://www.uebercoders.net/gms/), which I've been using for a while. It is really good.

When I started learning [RubyCocoa](http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/) recently, an idea came out: why not write a Gmail Notifier in RubyCocoa?

So here comes Gmail Notifr.
